## 📝 Project Description
- This repo hosts a hackathon project I built in 2022 to accompany Christmas presents.
- A Quickly built Mölkky scoreboard to accompany handmade Mölkky sets
- This is in no way affiliated with the brand Mlkky

This project is not great! but it stays up on GH despite this as its GH-page is linked to QR codes attached to the handmade Mölkky sets we gave as gifts
